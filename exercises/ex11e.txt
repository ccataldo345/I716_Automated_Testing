Exercise Lesson 11

Necessary code is in directory src/main/java/string.

The purpose of the exercise is to use transforming results pattern.
(http://mkalmo.xyz/i716/slides/at10e.pdf lk 14-20).

To make tests in string.OrderServiceTest pass, you need to write implementations
for the methods in OrderService class and helper methods that transform the results.

Specifications for the OrderService methods:

  List<Order> getFilledOrders()
      - returns orders on which isFilled() returns true.

  List<Order> getOrdersOver(double amount)
      - returns orders on which getTotal() is over the value provided (amount argument).

  List<Order> getOrdersSortedByDate()
       - returns all orders sorted by date
       To convert date objects to string use method OrderServiceTest.asString(Date date).
