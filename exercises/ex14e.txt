Page Objects I

Necessary code is in directory src/main/java/selenium.

The application to test: http://enos.itcollege.ee/~mkalmo/selenium

Make the tests in selenium.PageObjectTest pass.

1. loginFailsWithFalseCredentials() - checks that it is not possible to 
   log in with wrong credentials.

2. loginSucceedsWithCorrectCredentials() - checks that it is possible to 
   log in with correct credentials (user:1).

3. canLogOut() - checks that clicking logout link takes to login page 
   and shows log out success message.

Everything that is related to Selenium goes to Page Objects and tests 
do not have any references to Selenium.
