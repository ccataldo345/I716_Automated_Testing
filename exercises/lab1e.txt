Game of Life

Necessary code is in directory src/main/java/gol.

Mark your work with tag lab1.

Write application with the following functionality:

  There is a board with M x N squares. 
  Each square represents a cell.
  Each cell has up to 8 neighbors (North, South, East, West, NE, SE, SW, NW).
    Cell has less than 8 neighbors if it is on the edge of a board.
  At the beginning the board is empty (or full of dead cells).
  It is possible to mark some of the cells as alive.
  There is a method for calculating next board state based on the current 
    state following certain rules. Whether cell lives on next board state 
    depends on how many neighbors it currently has.
  
Rules

  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
  
Grading criteria

  Tests are the important part.
  Test names are very important.
  Tests should give as confidence that the program works.
  There are no tests that does not do anything useful (the more is not always the better).
