Exercise 4

Write a class RpnCalculator (RPN - Reverse Polish Notation). 
Before writing the code, write a test for that code. 
Try to not write any code before you have test for it.

Graphical example of an RPN calculator: http://www.alcula.com/calculators/rpn/

Methods of the calculator
  int getAccumulator() - returns the value from the accumulator.
  void setAccumulator(int number) - sets the accumulator's value.
  void enter() - pushes accumulator's value onto the stack.
  void plus() - removes the topmost element from the stack and adds its value to the accumulator.
  void minus() - removes the topmost element from the stack and substracts accumulator's value from it.
                 puts the result into the accumulator.
  void multiply() - removes the topmost element from the stack and multiplies accumulator's value with it.
  int evaluate(String expression) - takes an expression in string form and returns the result as an integer.


Write tests at least for the following cases:

1. Create calculator and assert that accumulator is 0
2. Check that it is possible to set the accumulator
3. Check that calculator calculates correctly 1 + 2 = 3
4. Check that calculator calculates correctly 3 - 1 = 2
5. Check that calculator calculates correctly (1 + 2) * 4 = 12
6. Check that calculator calculates correctly (4 + 3) * (2 + 1) = 21
7. Check that calculator calculates correctly "5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 +"  -> 20
