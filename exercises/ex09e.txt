Exercise Lesson 9

Necessary code is in directory src/main/java/custommock and src/main/java/mockito.

Exercise 1 - Mocks Without Framework

   a) Make custommock.TransferServiceTest.transfersWithCurrencyConversion() test pass.
      To accomplish this you have to finish TestableBankService mock, 
      which is being used for testing TransferService.

   b) Make custommock.TransferServiceTest.doesNotTransferWhenNoFounds() test pass.
      To accomplish this you have to make it so that it is possible to 
      specify whether there is enough money on the account. 
   
Exercise 2 - Introduction to Mockito Framework

  Look over the Mockito framework examples from the lecture. And be sure 
  that you understand how they work. Write content to the tests in the 
  mockito.TransferServiceTestMockitoSimple class.
