Exercise Lesson 6

Mark commit with tag ex06.

Necessary code: src/main/java/sql.

Continue with the last lecture's exercises and implement methods in 
SelectBuilder.java so that tests 5-9 will pass.

Try to come up with descriptive names for the tests. Remember that test 
names should serve as a documentation for our code.
