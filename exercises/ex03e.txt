Exercise 3

Write class RpnCalculator (RPN - Reverse Polish Notation). 
Before writing code, write test for that code. 
Try to not write any code before you have test for it.

Graphical example of an RPN calculator: http://www.alcula.com/calculators/rpn/

Methods of the calculator:
  int getAccumulator() - returns the value from accumulator
  void setAccumulator(int number) - sets the accumulators value
  void enter() - pushes accumulators value onto the stack
  void plus() - removes topmost element from stack and adds its value to the accumulator

Write tests at least for the following cases:

1. Create calculator and assert that accumulator is 0
2. Check that it is possible to set the accumulator
3. Check that calculator calculates correctly 1 + 2 = 3

Sample test:

    @Test
    public void calculatorSupportsAddition() {
        RpnCalculator c = new RpnCalculator();
        c.setAccumulator(1);
        c.enter();
        
        c.setAccumulator(2);
        c.plus();
        
        assertThat(c.getAccumulator(), is(3));
    }
