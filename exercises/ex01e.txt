Exercise 1 (deadline 5. September 22:00)

NB! It is recommended to read the text carefully, so that you can get it 
right the first time. Fixing the errors later could take much more time. 

1. Create bitbucket.org account if you don’t have it already.

2. Fork repository https://bitbucket.org/mkalmo/i398 naming you fork i716. 
   Check that your repository is private.

3. Share the project with user mkalmo:
   Settings -> User and group access
   Add user mkalmo to "Users" list ("read" access).

4. Add Git hook

   Settings -> Webhooks -> Add webhook

   Fill these fields:

     Title: <some title>
     URL: http://mkalmo.xyz/ci/i716/api/notify

4. Import project into IDE (e.g. IDEA).
   In IDEA click on "Add as Maven Project" in right bottom corner.

5. Open file info.json and fill in the missing info.

  "firstName": "<Your first name>",
  "lastName": "<Your other name(s)>",
  "passwordHash": "<sha256 hash for the new password>"

   You can calculate the hash on those pages:
   
   http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator 
   or
   https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/

   For example:
   
   {
     "firstName": "Märt",
     "lastName": "Kalmo",
     "passwordHash": "7ac6b2736f34fce19d6b804eff5a1f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b47"
   }

6. Commit the changes.

7. Push the changes into BitBucket.

8. Add tag ex01 to the last commit.
   Commits -> click on last commit -> There is a plus symbol on the page for adding tags.
   
9. Check that you can log in to https://mkalmo.xyz/ci/i716.
   User: username for bitbucket.org account
   Password: password that you chose in step 5.

NB! If you can’t log in check that:
    - repository name for your fork is i716
    - you can see that from bitbucket.org that the correct commit has tag ex01
    - Check that you shared the repository with user mkalmo.
    - Be sure that you are using the right credentials for logging in (step 9)
    - Under webhooks it is possible to see notification requests. 
      Check that notification was sent and the request was successful.
  
If you wish to change the password then you can write new hash to info.json file and push the changes.
