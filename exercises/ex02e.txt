Write a code and unit tests for the class Stack. Write the tests before the code itself.
Not all the tests at once, but start from a test, then wite code to 
make the test pass, then next test and so on.

Operations for the class Stack:

void push(Integer i) - adds an argument to the stack
Integer pop() - removes the topmost element and returns it
Integer peek() - returns the topmost element
Integer size() - returns the element count on the stack. 

As an internal data structure use Integer array ((Integer[]).
The size of the array could be specified in the constructor.

Test at least the following cases:

- create stack and check that it is empty (has zero elements).
- create stack, push two elements and check that it contains two elements (size is 2).
- create stack, push two elements, pop two elements and check that it contains zero elements.
- create stack, push two elements, pop two elements and check that these are the elemets pushed before and the order is correct.
- create stack, push two elements, peek at the topmost element and check that it is the last one pushed.
- create stack, push two elements, peek at the topmost element and check that the stack contains two elements.
- create stack, pop one element and check that stack throws IllegalStateException.
- create stack, peek at the topmost element and check that stack throws IllegalStateException.

The first test:
