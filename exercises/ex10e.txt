Exercise Lesson 10

Necessary code is in directory src/main/java/mockito.

Make the tests in the mockito.TransferServiceTestMockito class pass.
 
  We would like to test TransferService.transfer() method. We think that 
  it is correct and we are not going to modify it. As this method does 
  not return anyting we can't use return value to decide whether it is correct.
  
  TransferService.transfer() depends on BankService but we don't have it yet.

  The solution is to use BankService mock that returns fixed values 
  (behaves as a stub) and also tells us which methods were called.

  a. Teach BankService mock how it should respond when methods getAccountCurrency(), 
     convert(), hasSufficientFundsFor() are called with different arguments.
     
     If this done then verify(bankService).withdraw on line 32 should pass.
 
  b. Verify that deposit() method was also called with the correct arguments.

  c. Write a test for the scenario when there are not enough money to 
     make the transfer (test transferWhenNotEnoughFunds()).
