Exercise Lesson 5

Mark commit with tag ex05.

Necessary code is in package src/main/java/sql.

SqlBuilder.java is a class for constructing sql statements.

If we want to construct sql statements dynamically in code then the 
naive approach would be:

  String column = "name"; // dynamic field name
  String table = "person"; // dynamic table name
  
  String sql = "select " + column + " from" + table;
  
               // the result would be "select name from person";

When the statements become more complecated the naive approach is hard to 
maintain and the following approach would be better.

  SelectBuilder builder = new SelectBuilder();
  builder.column(column);  // dynamic field name
  builder.from(table);     // dynamic table name
  
  String sql = b.getSql();

              // the result would be "select name from person";


SqlBuilderTest.java contains tests for SelectBuilder class.

Implement methods in SqlBuilder.java so that tests 1-4 will pass 
(test 5-9 are for the next exercise lesson)

Try to come up with descriptive names for the tests. Remember that test 
names should serve as a documentation for our code.
